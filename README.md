# THREE.JS Journey's R3F's tutorials implemented in threlte

In this repo you will find threejs-journey.com's final R3F tutorials implemented using svelte/threlte. I was able to accomplish most of the things taught in the lesson in threlte, however, it is missing some functionality that I will seek to update as the threlte ecosystem matures.

```

## Developing

To run this project use the following commands 
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Note you will have to change the App.svelte to point to the Experience.svelte in the right folder (Default is the final chapter in Marble race)

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
